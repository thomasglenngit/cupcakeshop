    <h1>Bite Me!</h1>
    <h2>The best cupcake shop in California!</h2>

    <p class="feature"> Founded in 1989, Bite Me! has been a Californian icon for over 30 years. We started out of our home kitchen and delivered cupcakes door to door in San Francisco. Thanks to our secret recipe, creative designs, generous portions, and loyal patrons our reputation grew and grew! We now have more than 20 locations in California and the Western United States and one in Vancouver, Canada!</p>

    <p class="feature"> Come into any one of our stores and enjoy the sites, smells, and friendly hospitality from our energetic staff. Feel free to order your cupcakes ahead of time using our app. We also cater our products for birthdays, office parties and more!</p>
